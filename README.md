# Handmade Hero 

This project is created for educational purposes following the Handmade Hero series by Casey Muratori. 
Although the code will look similar to the above project, it will diverge overtime as I learn more about game engine and game development.

## Progress

### Week 1

- Project setup
- Windows's Window handling and rendering of backbuffer to the screen

### Week 2

- XInput controls for Controller management
- Keyboard control for keyup/keydown events
